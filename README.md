# Sepsis-Clinical-Analytics-Project-V1

A first patient-level exploratory data analysis of ICU time-series data to investigate clinical differences between Sepsis and Non-Sepsis patients.

Built using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and real-world clinical data.


## Overview

This project analyzes ICU patient data to explore clinical differences between patients who develop sepsis and those who do not.

The goal is to build a **clean, interpretable, patient-level clinical analytics pipeline** using real-world hospital data.

---

## Objectives

- Identify patients with and without sepsis
- Handle missing clinical data
- Aggregate time-series ICU data into patient-level features
- Compare physiological patterns between groups
- Visualize clinically relevant differences

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains ICU time-series measurements from the the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019 including:

- Vital signs (HR, MAP, Resp, O2Sat, Temp)
- Laboratory values (Lactate, WBC, Creatinine)
- Patient denographics (Age, Gender)
- Sepsis label (binary outcome over time)

Each row represents one hour of a patient's ICU stay.

The original dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle. To keep this repository lightweight, a reduced sample dataset (sample_dataset_50k.csv) is included for demonstration and testing purposes. The complete dataset can be downloaded directly from Kaggle using the provided notebook.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Download
- Kaggle ICU dataset loaded via `kagglehub`
- Raw time-series patient data imported from CSV

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Missing value analysis performed
- Low-quality variables (>90% missing) removed
- Clinically relevant variables retained (e.g., HR, MAP, Lactate, Creatinine)

### 3. Feature Engineering (Patient-Level Aggregation)
- Time-series data aggregated into patient-level statistics
  - Mean, max, min values per vital sign
- Clinical baseline features included (Age, Gender)
- Outcome variable defined as `SepsisPatient`

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution comparisons between Sepsis vs Non-Sepsis patients
- Boxplots for key physiological markers
- Summary statistics table
- Correlation heatmap of clinical profiles

### 5. Interpretation Layer
- Identification of physiological patterns associated with sepsis:
  - Elevated lactate levels
  - Altered MAP and heart rate
  - Kidney function markers (creatinine)

---

## Key Findings

Sepsis patients show:

- Higher heart rate (HR)
- Lower mean arterial pressure (MAP)
- Elevated lactate levels
- Increased creatinine levels

These findings align with known clinical patterns of septic shock and organ dysfunction.

---

## Discussion

This analysis demonstrates that even simple patient-level aggregation of ICU time-series data can reveal clinically meaningful differences between Sepsis and Non-Sepsis patients.

The observed patterns are consistent with clinical knowledge of sepsis pathophysiology:

- Distributive shock with a systemic shift of fluids to the tissue leads to an increased heart reflecting compensatory cardiovascular stress.
- Reduced mean arterial pressure is consistent with reduced vessel fluids.
- Elevated lactate levels indicate tissue hypoperfusion and anaerobic metabolism.
- Increased creatinine suggests early signs of renal dysfunction in severe cases.

### Limitations

- Temporal dynamics are not modeled (loss of time-series information through aggregation before- and after diagnosing sepsis).
- Aggregated statistics (mean/max/min) may conceal clinically relevant pattern changes before and after sepsis onset.
- No predictive modeling is performed in this V1 version.
- Missing data handling is simplified and may introduce bias.

### Clinical Relevance

Despite its simplicity, this analysis provides a clear and interpretable overview of physiological differences associated with sepsis. It serves as a foundation for more advanced data science, predictive modeling and time-series analysis in future work (V2).
